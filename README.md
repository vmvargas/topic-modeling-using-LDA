# Overview
Topic models automatically infer the topics discussed in a collection of documents. These topics can be used to summarize and organize documents, or used for featurization and dimensionality reduction in later stages of the data analysis. 

LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is a topic model library. I used LDA in this project to derive ‘topics’ from the dataset provided, the code was written in Python.


## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Yelp’s website.

## Script Steps

⋅⋅1.1. Tokenizing
⋅⋅1.2. Stopping
⋅⋅1.3. Stemming
2. Construct a Document-term Matrix
